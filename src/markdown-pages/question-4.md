### Gatsby.

> I made my site using Gatsby. Although, I have used React but have neither used Gatsby nor GraphQL.
> I chose Gatsby because it gives an opportunity to learn Gatsby and GraphQL, therefore, adding more tools to my toolbox and giving me more capabilities to solve wider scope of problems within the React ecosystem.

> Gatsby style of setting up this blog is way different from how I would typically set up a react project as Gatsby requires a lot of plugins and configurations.

> I had to dig through the documentation, do some google searches and went through a few example code in order to gain the knowledge needed to setup this site.
> Indeed, I am happy to have learn a new thing.
