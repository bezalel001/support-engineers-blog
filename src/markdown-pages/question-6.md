### SSL/HTTPS is important for a couple reasons

> Search engine ranking boosts: Google designs its ranking algorithms to prioritise sites served over https. This means that a website with HTTPS is more likely to be visible to users searching for information using Google search.

> Web browsers: Having a secured padlock in the address bar of a browser can give visitors enough confidence to make payments through such a website. They have the confidence that whatever they are doing is secured.

> Content integrity and Referral analytics are also very important reasons for using HTTPS. See [HTTPS (SSL) | Netlify Docs](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/https-ssl/)
