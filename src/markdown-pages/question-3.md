### My Thoughts About Netlify Service

> I have had experiences with other static site hosting services and I can categorically say that netlify is the absolute best of them all.
> Your backend static sites hosting service is absolutely amazing. The free tier is extremely generous (https, continuous deployment with github etc), it gives way more than a developer typically need and more importantly, it's incredibly easy to use.

> In fact, it is actually because of my experience in deploying static sites on netlify that informed my decision to be part of this exciting journey of creating a better web at Netlify...helping developers and none developers to be more productive.

> Indeed, in my opinion, it cannot be much easier to launch a static site in a secured and scalable way than it is with Netlify. If it's going to be easier in the next few years, Netlify would still be the one to lead the way.
