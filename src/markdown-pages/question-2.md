### My favorite thing about providing technical support.

> Providing support to me means a lifetime of service, which I absolutely love. Almost everything in our daily lives is linked to technology. Therefore, focusing my energy and time in helping others to understand and make full use of tech products guarantees that I am making a difference in the lives of others.

> Tehnical support provides, I would say, the best importunity for me to truly be at my best. This is because It gives me the platform to continously learn and become better in teachning, empathy and emotional intelligence, problem solving, communication, excellence etc
