Hi [Customers name]

Thanks for reaching out to us!

Would you please confirm if it builds locally on your own development environment? If this is so, please check to make sure the package versions we use to build matches yours.

You’ll find this documentation useful: https://www.netlify.com/docs/build-gotchas/

I’ll be happy to help if you have further questions.

Best,
